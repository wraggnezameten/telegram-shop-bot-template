This is an example Telegram shop bot. It's a simple and, most importantly, efficient way to place an order without leaving your favorite messenger.

## What can it do?

1. `/start` - needed to start the bot and choose the mode (user/admin).

2. `/menu` - go to the menu.

3. `/sos` - ask the administrator a question.

## Menu

The user menu looks like this:

## Catalog

The catalog consists of products sorted by categories. Users can add items to their cart, and the admin has full control over catalog management (addition/removal).

## Cart

The ordering process looks like this: the user goes to the `🛍️ Catalog`, selects the desired category, chooses products, and clicks the `🛒 Cart` button.

Then, after making sure everything is in place, proceed to checkout by clicking `📦 Place Order`.

To add a product, select a category and click the `➕ Add Product` button. Then, fill out the "name-description-image-price" form and confirm.
